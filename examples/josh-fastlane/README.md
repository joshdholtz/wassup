# Josh's _fastlane_ Example

## Purpose
I need to view a lot of different _fastlane_ things at one glance between _fastlane_'s two organizations:
- https://github.com/fastlane
- https://github.com/fastlane-community

I mainly need to watch PRs on https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/ but also all PRs from all the repos in https://github.com/fastlane-community

I also like to see some stats on PR count (and eventually issues and hot/trending issues)

It's also nice to have a quick glace of CircleCI jobs
